//Optimal Approach

/**
 * Detects if a singly linked list contains a cycle.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - This uses Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
 * - Two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) traverse the list:
 *   - `slow` moves one step at a time.
 *   - `fast` moves two steps at a time.
 * - If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet,
 *   meaning the while-loop termination condition (`fast != null && fast.next != null`) will not be met, leading to an infinite loop.
 * - If there is no cycle, `fast` or `fast.next` will reach `null`, and the loop terminates safely without entering an infinite loop.
 *
 * Explanation for pointer meeting in case of a loop:
 * - At the first instant when both pointers enter the loop, the gap between the
 *   fast and slow pointers (measured in the clockwise direction) is at its maximum.
 * - As both pointers continue moving, the fast pointer gradually reduces the gap by 1 step in each subsequent iteration.
 * - This happens because the fast pointer moves 2 steps for every 1 step the slow pointer takes. 
 *   As a result, the fast pointer eventually catches up with the slow pointer.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * - If the list is empty (`head == null`), there is no cycle.
 * - If the list has only one node (`head.next == null`), there is no cycle.
 * - For an **odd-sized list** (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3`), the loop ends when `fast.next == null`.
 * - For an **even-sized list** (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`), the loop ends when `fast == null`.
 *
 * Example of Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare):
 *
 * Linked list structure with cycle:
 * A -> B -> C -> D -> E
 *           ^         |
 *           |         v
 *           H <- G <- F
 *
 * Node indexing:
 * 0: A
 * 1: B
 * 2: C  <- cycle starts here
 * 3: D
 * 4: E
 * 5: F
 * 6: G
 * 7: H
 *      ↘ back to C (node 2)
 *
 * Step-by-step movement of slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps):
 *
 * Step | slow at | fast at
 * -----|---------|---------
 * 0    | A (0)   | A (0)
 * 1    | B (1)   | C (2)
 * 2    | C (2)   | E (4)
 * 3    | D (3)   | G (6)
 * 4    | E (4)   | C (2)
 * 5    | F (5)   | E (4)
 * 6    | G (6)   | G (6)   <-- slow and fast meet here (inside cycle)
 *
 * - They meet at node G (index 6), confirming a cycle exists.
 * - This meeting point is not necessarily the cycle's start.
 *
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * How to find the length of the cycle:
 *
 * - After detecting the cycle (i.e., when slow == fast), initialize a counter.
 * - Move one pointer (say `slow`) one step at a time and increment the counter.
 * - Stop when `slow` returns to the same node (i.e., completes one full loop).
 * - The counter now holds the **length of the loop**.
 *
 * Example:
 * - Suppose they meet at node G.
 * - Start from G, move to H, then C, ..., back to G.
 * - Count how many steps it takes to return to G → this is the loop length.
