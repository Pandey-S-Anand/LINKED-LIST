/*
 * Why is the node not the last node?
 * 
 * The given node is guaranteed not to be the last node because the deletion strategy 
 * involves copying the value of the next node into the current node. The final step is 
 * detaching the last node by setting the next pointer of the second-to-last node to null, 
 * effectively removing the last node from the list.
 * 
 * Why are all values distinct?
 * 
 * If the node values were not distinct, there would be ambiguity in identifying which node 
 * has been deleted based solely on the list structure after the operation. Distinct values 
 * ensure that the modified list maintains a clear and unambiguous state after the deletion operation.

 * 3. The original node with value 3 remains in memory, still pointing to the node with value 4, but it is no longer accessible by any other node in the linked list.
