/**
 * Detects if a singly linked list contains a cycle.
 *
 * Approach:
 * - This uses Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare).
 * - Two pointers (`slow` and `fast`) traverse the list:
 *   - `slow` moves one step at a time.
 *   - `fast` moves two steps at a time.
 * - If there is a cycle, the `slow` and `fast` pointers will eventually meet,
 *   meaning the while-loop termination condition (`fast != null && fast.next != null`) will not be met, leading to an infinite loop.
 * - If there is no cycle, `fast` or `fast.next` will reach `null`, and the loop terminates safely without entering an infinite loop.
 *
 * Explanation for pointer meeting in case of a loop:
 * - At the first instant when both pointers enter the loop, the gap between the
 *   fast and slow pointers (measured in the clockwise direction) is at its maximum.
 * - As both pointers continue moving, the fast pointer gradually reduces the gap by 1 step in each subsequent iteration.
 * - This happens because the fast pointer moves 2 steps for every 1 step the slow pointer takes. 
 *   As a result, the fast pointer eventually catches up with the slow pointer.
 *
 * Edge Cases:
 * - If the list is empty (`head == null`), there is no cycle.
 * - If the list has only one node (`head.next == null`), there is no cycle.
 * - For an **odd-sized list** (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3`), the loop ends when `fast.next == null`.
 * - For an **even-sized list** (e.g., `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4`), the loop ends when `fast == null`.
 *
 * Example of Floyd's Cycle Detection (Tortoise and Hare):
 *
 * Linked list structure with cycle:
 * A -> B -> C -> D -> E
 *           ^         |
 *           |         v
 *           H <- G <- F
 *
 * Node indexing:
 * 0: A
 * 1: B
 * 2: C  <- cycle starts here
 * 3: D
 * 4: E
 * 5: F
 * 6: G
 * 7: H
 *      ↘ points back to C (node 2)
 *
 * Step-by-step movement of slow (1 step) and fast (2 steps):
 *
 * Step | slow at | fast at
 * -----|---------|---------
 * 0    | A (0)   | A (0)
 * 1    | B (1)   | C (2)
 * 2    | C (2)   | E (4)
 * 3    | D (3)   | G (6)
 * 4    | E (4)   | C (2)
 * 5    | F (5)   | E (4)
 * 6    | G (6)   | G (6)   <-- slow and fast meet here (inside cycle)
 *
 * - They meet at node G (index 6), confirming a cycle exists.
 * - This meeting point is not necessarily the cycle's start.
 *
 * The `getCycleStart` method works because of the following reasoning:
 *
 *   Distances:
 * - L = distance from head to start of cycle = 2 (A → B → C)
 * - X = distance from start of cycle (C) to meeting point (G) = 4 (C → D → E → F → G)
 * - C = total cycle length = 6 (C → D → E → F → G → H → C)
 *
 * Step 2: Key Distance Relationship
 * - When the pointers meet at the meeting point (M), the distances traveled are:
 *   - `slow`: L + X
 *   - `fast`: L + X + k * C (where k is the number of full loops by `fast`).
 * - Since `fast` moves twice as fast as `slow`:
 *   2(L + X) = L + X + k * C
 *   => L + X = k * C
 * - This implies that the distance from the head to the start of the cycle (L)
 *   is equal to the distance from the meeting point to the start of the cycle (C - X).
 *
 * Step 3: Resetting and Moving Pointers
 * - One pointer (`slow`) is reset to the head.
 * - The other pointer (`fast`) remains at the meeting point (M).
 * - Both pointers move one step at a time.
 * - After L steps from the head and (C - X) steps from the meeting point,
 *   both pointers will meet at the start of the cycle.
 *
 * This ensures that the algorithm correctly identifies the start of the cycle.
