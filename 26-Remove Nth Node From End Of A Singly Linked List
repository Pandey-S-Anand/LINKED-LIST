//Optimal approach

/*
 * The algorithm uses the two-pointer technique to efficiently remove the N-th node from the end of the list.
 * 
 * 1. The fast pointer is advanced by `n` steps ahead of the slow pointer. This creates a gap of `n` nodes between them.
 *    - By the time the fast pointer reaches the last node (i.e., `fast.next == null`), the slow pointer will be 
 *      positioned just before the node that needs to be deleted.
 * 
 * 2. After advancing the fast pointer, both pointers (fast and slow) are moved simultaneously, one step at a time, 
 *    until the fast pointer reaches the last node. This ensures that when the fast pointer reaches the last node, 
 *    the slow pointer is at the node just before the target node to be deleted.
 * 
 * 3. If the fast pointer becomes `null` after moving `n` steps, it means the node to be deleted is the head of the list.
 *    - In this case, we return `head.next`, effectively removing the head node.
